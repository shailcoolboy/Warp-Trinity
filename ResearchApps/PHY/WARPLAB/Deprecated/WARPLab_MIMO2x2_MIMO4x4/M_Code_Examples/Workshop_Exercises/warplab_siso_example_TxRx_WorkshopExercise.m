% Transmitting and Receiving Data using WARPLab (SISO Configuration)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% To run this M-code the boards must be programmed with the
% warplab_mimo_2x2_v03.bit bitstream (because this bitstream provides 
% storage of RSSI values and this M-code reads RSSI values). This M-code 
% will work with the warplab_mimo_4x4_v03.bit bitstream when reading of 
% RSSI values is deleted from the M-code.

% The specific steps implemented in this script are the following

% 0. Initializaton and definition of parameters
% 1. Generate a vector of samples to transmit and send the samples to the 
% WARP board (Sample Frequency is 40MHz)
% 2. Prepare WARP boards for transmission and reception and send trigger to 
% start transmission and reception (trigger is the SYNC packet)
% 3. Read the received samples from the WARP board
% 4. Reset and disable the boards
% 5. Plot the transmitted and received data and close sockets

% In this lab exercise you will write a matlab script that implements the
% six steps above. Part of the code is provided, some part of the code you
% will write. Read the code below and fill in with your code wherever you 
% are asked to do so.

% NOTE: To avoid conflict with other groups using the boards, please test 
% the code you write in this script in any of the following three ways:
%
% Option 1. Run this script from MATLAB's Command Window by entering the 
% name of the script (enter warplab_siso_example_TxRx_WorkshopExercise in 
% matlab's Command Window).
% Option 2. In the menu bar go to Debug and select Run. If there
% are errors in the code, error messages will appear in the Command Window.
% Option 3. Press F5. If the are errors in the code, error messages will 
% appear in the Command Window.
%
% DO NOT USE the Evaluate selection option and DO NOT run the script by
% sections. To test any change, always run the whole script by following 
% any of the three options above.

% USER CODE HERE

% Create the following variables and assign them valid values: 

% CaptOffset: Number of noise samples per Rx capture. In [0:2^14]
% TxLength: Length of transmission. In [0:2^14-1-CaptOffset]
% CarrierChannel: Channel in the 2.4 GHz band. In [1:14]
% Node1_Radio2_TxGain_BB: Tx Baseband Gain. In [0:3]
% Node1_Radio2_TxGain_RF: Tx RF Gain. In [0:63]
% Node2_Radio2_RxGain_BB: Rx Baseband Gain. In [0:31]
% Node2_Radio2_RxGain_RF: Rx RF Gain. In [1:3]  

% Note: For this experiment node 1 will be set as the transmitter and node 
% 2 will be set as the receiver (this is done later in the code), hence, 
% there is no need to define receive gains for node 1 and there is no
% need to define transmitter gains for node 2.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%

TxMode = 0; % Transmission mode. In [0:1] 
            % 0: Single Transmission 
            % 1: Continuous Transmission. Tx board will continue 
            % transmitting the vector of samples until the user manually
            % disables the transmitter. 

% Download the WARPLab parameters to the WARP nodes. 
% The nodes store the CaptOffset, TxLength, and TxMode parameters in 
% registers defined in the WARPLab sysgen model. The nodes set radio 
% related parameters CarrierChannel, TxGains, and RxGains, using the 
% radio controller functions.
% The CaptOffset is a parameter that needs to be known at the receiver
% node; knowledge of CaptOffset is not required at the transmitter. For 
% this exercise node 2 will be set as the receiver (this is done later in 
% the code). Since CaptOffset is only required at the receiver we
% download the CaptOffset value only to the receiver node (node 2).

% the transmitter (this is done later in the code). Since TxLength and
% TxMode are only required at the transmitter we download the TxLength and
% TxMode parameters only to the transmitter node (node 1).

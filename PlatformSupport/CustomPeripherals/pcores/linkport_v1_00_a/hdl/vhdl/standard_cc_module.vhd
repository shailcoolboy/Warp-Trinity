--
--  Description: This module drives the Aurora module's Clock Compensation
--               interface.  Clock Compensation sequences are generated according
--               to the requirements in the Aurora Protocol specification.
--
--               This module supports Aurora Modules with any number of
--               2-byte lanes and no User Flow Control.

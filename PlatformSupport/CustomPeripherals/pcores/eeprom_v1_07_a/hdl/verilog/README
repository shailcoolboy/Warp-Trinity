The OneWire master Verilog used here is provided by Maxim/Dallas Semi. The
code is pretty hard to find via their web page, but the license statement
at the top of each file indicates it's available for use and distribution
without licensing restriction.

We got the code from:
ftp://ftp.dalsemi.com/pub/auto_id/licensed/ds1wm.zip

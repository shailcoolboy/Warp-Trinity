--  Description : The ERROR_DETECT module monitors the MGT to detect hard
--                errors.  It accumulates the Soft errors according to the
--                leaky bucket algorithm described in the Aurora
--                Specification to detect Hard errors.  All errors are
--                reported to the Global Logic Interface.

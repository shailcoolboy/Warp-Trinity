The source files for the AGC peripheral are not openly available. The AGC algorithm implemented in the core
is based on an algorithm described in a technical document from Maxim Integrated Products, the manufacturer
of the RF transceiver chip on the WARP radio board. We obtained this document under a non-disclosure agreement
with Maxim which precludes us from releasing the source for code which is based on the document's contents.
